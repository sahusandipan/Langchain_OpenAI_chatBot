# Customizing a Chatbot using OpenAI API, LangChain, Prompt Templates, and Memory  

## 📌 Project Description  

This project demonstrates how to build and customize an AI-powered chatbot using **OpenAI's API**, **LangChain**, **Prompt Templates**, and **Memory** to create a more dynamic and context-aware conversational agent. The chatbot is designed to handle multi-turn conversations while retaining past interactions, ensuring a seamless user experience.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Uses GPT models from OpenAI to generate responses.  
- **LangChain Framework**: Implements LangChain to efficiently manage prompts, chaining, and memory for better response handling.  
- **Prompt Engineering**: Utilizes **Prompt Templates** to fine-tune chatbot behavior and structure responses for various applications.  
- **Memory Management**: Implements **short-term** and **long-term memory** to maintain conversation history and improve user experience.  
- **Customizable Responses**: Allows developers to tweak prompts and memory settings for different chatbot use cases (customer support, FAQs, tutoring, etc.).  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- OpenAI API  
- LangChain  
- FastAPI (optional for deployment)  
- Streamlit (for building an interactive UI)  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
